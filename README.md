# My_python_training
My very first codes written when I started learning python.

Each code has it's own commentary in the file itself. I doing this project to learn the basics of Python
as well as leaarning how to use GitHub.

Feel free to use my code for whatever you desire (I doubt you ever will, tho :D)

Thanks for reading
